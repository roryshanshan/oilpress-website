# Company Advantages

## Product Introduction and Structural Principles

This product adopts the world's advanced hydraulic system, with the power source being an ultra-high pressure combined hydraulic station. The hydraulic station is equipped with high and low combined dual pumps, the cylinder lifting speed is doubled, and the working pump pressure can reach 63Mpa. Large capacity, high pressure, high oil yield. Mainly suitable for pressing tea seeds, rapeseeds, flaxseeds, peanuts, soybeans, white clay, animal oil sludge, etc., and can also be used for dehydration of various chemical raw materials and fruits and vegetables.

### Oil Press Structure and Working Principle
1. This machine is mainly composed of frame, oil cylinder, hydraulic station, manual directional valve, strip-arranged oil barrel, tray and microcomputer control part.
2. Working principle: This machine adopts microcomputer controlled hydraulic system, according to the principle of liquid static pressure transmission, using hydraulic oil as the pressure transmission medium, squeezing oil materials to squeeze out oil and fat. It is composed of hydraulic system and oil press body, forming a closed loop system.

### Advantages of Oil Press
- **High oil yield**: Compared with old-style drilled barrel oil presses, the normal oil yield can be 1-3 percentage points higher. For every 100 jin of peanuts processed, an average of 1-3 jin more oil can be obtained, and the annual economic benefits are very considerable.
- **Energy saving**: Under the same output, power consumption is reduced by 40%. Calculated at an average saving of 6 kWh per hour, daily production can save 30 yuan in electricity costs.
- **Labor saving**: Under the same output, labor can be saved by 60%, 1-2 people can organize production, and daily labor efficiency can save about 40 yuan.
- **Wide application**: Multi-purpose machine, can also press tea seeds, peanuts, soybeans, flaxseeds, sesame, rapeseeds, sunflowers, cottonseeds and more than 30 kinds of oil crops. Multi-stage pressing, one-time pressing clean.
- **Small footprint**: Oil mill needs only 10-20 square meters to meet the use.

### Innovative Design, Electromechanical Integration
Scientific design, reasonable structure, simple operation, safe and stable, adopting higher full-automatic microcomputer device, from feeding to finished product, only takes a few minutes to complete.

### Structural Innovation, More Reasonable Cake Discharge Device
This machine adopts ultra-large channel steel manufacturing, more solid, bearing pressure up to 300 tons. The cake discharge device is equipped with 4 hooks, the barrel is more solid when discharging cake, not easy to fall off, even overnight cake can be discharged, solving the problem of difficult cake discharge. Rapid loading, improving the overall processing efficiency, more energy-saving and electricity-saving, thereby reducing processing costs, more convenient loading, reducing work fatigue, protecting physical health.

### Excellent Material, Precise Process
Made of high carbon steel, through high-frequency quenching and heat treatment, high hardness, high strength, good wear resistance, suitable for high temperature and high pressure continuous operation, improving the service life of the oil press, can be used for decades.

### Reasonable Barrel Design, High Oil Yield
The pressing barrel adopts the strip-arranged pressing barrel independently developed by our factory, the oil outlet area is 15 times that of the drilled pressing barrel, oil comes out faster, clearer, and higher. No need to clean the pressing barrel, no oil channel blockage, no upward oil turning in the barrel, reducing labor intensity. Adopting multi-stage progressive pressure increase principle, making oil materials crack and separate at one time, activating oil molecules, pressing out all at once, greatly improving oil yield.

### Suitable for All Seasons, No Restrictions
This oil press is not restricted by climate, suitable for north and south all year round, can operate all year round.

### Wide Pressing Range, Multi-purpose Machine
Regardless of climate differences across the country, truly achieving the effect of oil production upon startup, fast pressing speed, can widely press sesame, peanuts, soybeans, rapeseeds, sunflowers, flaxseeds, tea seeds, cottonseeds, Sichuan pepper seeds, walnuts, tung seeds, castor, almonds and other oil crops.
