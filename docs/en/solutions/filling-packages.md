# Filling Packages Overview

This page provides an overview of our filling line solutions for bottled, bagged and drum-packed edible oils and specialty oils. The solutions cover dosing, capping, labeling, case packing and online inspection.

## Overview

Based on extensive experience in oil processing and packaging, we provide turnkey solutions from raw material intake to finished product storage. Solutions can be customized by capacity, package type and automation level — from economical semi-automatic lines for small workshops to high-speed fully automatic intelligent lines for modern factories.

## Main Modules

- Raw material handling & pretreatment
- Filling machines (weight/volume/flowmeter based)
- Metering & supply systems
- Capping/sealing units
- Labeling/inkjet coding
- Case packing/shrink wrap/palletizing
- Online inspection (weight, leak, foreign object, label)
- Conveying and buffering systems
- Central control & data acquisition (PLC/SCADA)

## Typical Models & Capacity

- Low-speed semi-auto: 300–1,000 bottles/hour
- Mid-speed semi-auto: 1,000–3,000 bottles/hour
- High-speed fully automatic: 3,000–20,000 bottles/hour (depends on bottle type and metering)

## Process Flow Example

1. Feeding & filtration -> 2. Metering supply -> 3. Dosing/filling -> 4. Capping -> 5. Labeling/coding -> 6. Vision/weight inspection -> 7. Packing & palletizing -> 8. Finished goods storage

## Technical Highlights

- High-precision dosing: weight or volumetric systems, filling accuracy up to ±0.5% depending on product and range.
- Anti-drip & anti-oxidation design: special return and venting to reduce oxidation and waste.
- Modular design: flexible combination and easy expansion.
- Automation & data: batch traceability, production reports, remote monitoring.

## Applicable Scenarios

- Edible vegetable oils (peanut, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower, etc.)
- Nut and specialty oils (walnut, almond, grape seed, etc.)
- Functional and refined oils
- Small OEM/custom brand production lines

## Selection Tips

- For multiple small-batch SKUs choose modular semi-auto lines to reduce CAPEX.
- For high-volume single SKU lines choose high-speed automatic systems with quick change fixtures.
- For high-viscosity or particulate oils include pre-filtration and pressurized supply.

## After-sales & Service

We offer:

- Installation, commissioning and training
- On-site process optimization and recipe advice
- Spare parts supply and remote diagnostics
- Regular maintenance and upgrades
