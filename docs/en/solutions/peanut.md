## Overview

Peanut is an important oilseed and cash crop, and peanut oil has unique aroma and rich nutritional value. Shandong Shengshi Hecheng Machinery Co., Ltd. provides professional peanut pressing solutions to meet different needs from small workshops to large factories.

## Product Introduction

This machine adopts advanced computer-aided design and manufacturing CAD/CAM, sourced from German technology high and low pressure dual pump combination ultra-high pressure hydraulic system, making the whole machine have the advantages of simple operation, large pressing force, low residual oil rate in cake, high production efficiency, energy saving and efficiency, and can also achieve constant temperature self-control, greatly reducing the labor intensity of workers. Its characteristics are mainly reflected in the following aspects:

1. Simple operation, high degree of automation, significantly reducing the labor intensity and skill requirements of workers. Compared with traditional oil pressing equipment, the product has a simple and practical structural appearance, small size, small footprint, easy to learn, easy to understand, easy to operate, no special requirements for operators. Only need to make simple settings on the time relay, you can realize the full automation of the oil pressing process, the combination design of the pressing cylinder and oil pan makes loading and cake discharging very convenient, worry-free, labor-saving, time-saving.

2. High production efficiency, energy-saving and environmentally friendly, reasonable production process. The machine is equipped with motor 2.2KW, adopts high and low pressure dual pump combination ultra-high pressure hydraulic system, which not only ensures the rapid action during initial pressing and cake discharging, but also ensures the high pressure needs during oil dripping, energy-saving and efficient, compact structure, maximum pressure up to 60MPa. Through constant pressure self-control, intermittent pressing, pressure maintaining and oil dripping and other scientific and reasonable pressing measures and cake surface pressure greater than 13 MPa, while ensuring the residual oil rate below the national standard, it also improves production efficiency, making the production process more reasonable. Simple loading operation, closed pressing, complete cake forming and discharging, making the environment easy to manage and more hygienic.

3. Product quality is safe and reliable, long service life. At the beginning of research and development, the structural and performance of the product were computer-simulated analysis and optimization. The whole machine is made of high-strength materials and multi-protection design, even if misoperation will not cause damage to the equipment. One of the key components of the machine is the hydraulic cylinder, we have accumulated many years of manufacturing experience to build it, not only selected world-famous brand seals, but also used the most sophisticated equipment for processing, each hydraulic cylinder is strictly tested before leaving the factory, providing a guarantee for the overall performance. Rigorous processing technology, sophisticated manufacturing equipment, reasonable process equipment, strict process control, perfect detection means, ensure the quality of products. Comprehensive inspection before leaving the factory does not let go of any details, so that every machine leaving the factory is a fine product, so that users can use it with confidence.

4. Convenient maintenance, low failure rate. The machine runs smoothly and reliably, no daily maintenance and upkeep is required, generally no failure occurs, saving time for users to create more benefits.

## Peanut Oil Processing and Advantages

### üõ† Processing Technology Overview
The production process of peanut oil mainly includes cleaning, crushing, roasting, pressing, filtering and sedimentation. Our factory adopts hydraulic cold pressing or hot pressing processes, which can be flexibly configured according to customer needs:

- **Cold Pressing Process**: Maintains the original flavor and nutritional components of peanut oil, with clear color and soft taste.
- **Hot Pressing Process**: By controlling the roasting temperature, the peanut aroma is more intense and the oil yield is higher.

Hydraulic oil press uses pure physical extrusion principle, without adding any chemical solvents, pure oil quality, suitable for producing high-end edible oil.

### ü•á Peanut Oil Advantages
1Ô∏è‚É£ Rich in Unsaturated Fatty Acids
	‚Ä¢	Oleic acid accounts for 40-50% in peanut oil, linoleic acid accounts for 30-40%, both are healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids.
	‚Ä¢	Helps reduce cholesterol in the blood and protect cardiovascular health.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Rich in Vitamins and Antioxidants
	‚Ä¢	Contains Vitamin E and phytosterols, with antioxidant effects, helping to delay aging and protect cell health.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Healthy Cooking Oil
	‚Ä¢	Cold-pressed peanut oil retains natural nutrition, pure taste, suitable for cold dishes, frying, stir-frying and other cooking methods.
	‚Ä¢	Has a high smoke point, less likely to produce harmful substances when frying.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Improve Immunity and Digestion
	‚Ä¢	The nutritional components of peanut oil help enhance immunity and also have certain protective effects on the digestive system.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Natural Flavor and Taste
	‚Ä¢	Peanut oil has a rich aroma, soft taste, can enhance the flavor of dishes, especially suitable for Chinese cooking.

## Peanut Hot Pressing Process Description
+ Peanut (recommended 300AC-390/325AC-390/355AC-390/400AC-390)
+ Peanut Oil (Aromatic Type) Hot Pressing Process: Crush peanuts - flat-bottomed wok frying peanut grits - directly feed into hydraulic oil press bucket for pressing
   + The peanut oil produced by this process has a rich aroma, golden and bright color, good taste, and does not require hydration treatment with no foaming when cooking.
   + Basically no filtration treatment is needed, just sedimentation and bottling. This is the pressing process adopted by COFCO Group's premium peanut oil (the crushing, frying, pressing, and filtration equipment for this project are provided by our factory).
