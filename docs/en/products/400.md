## Series Overview

The 400 Series Hydraulic Oil Press is our classic model, suitable for small and medium-sized oil mills. This series features compact structure, simple operation, and stable performance.

It mainly consists of frame, hydraulic cylinder, and material barrel. The control box uses a microcomputer controller, all programs are software connected, and the control program will not be damaged.
<font color=red>Notice: The frame is made of integrated molded steel plate cutting, with higher yield strength and stronger pressure bearing capacity</font>

The 400 model is suitable for hot pressing: sesame, tea seed, walnut, peanut, soybean, flax, rapeseed, sunflower seed, oil sludge, oil residue, meal, waste clay, animal oil residue, medicinal residue dehydration.

Dual barrel dual sliding track design - when one barrel is pressing, it does not affect the other barrel loading, greatly improving work efficiency.
