## Product Overview

This machine is suitable for various bean cakes, peanut cakes, cottonseed cakes, and other block or granular materials. It has a simple structure and is easy to maintain, making it an essential product for large feed processing plants. The product is mainly composed of a frame, motor, and crushing box. After oil extraction, residual oil materials (cake blocks) are put into the pulverizer, where they are repeatedly struck by high-speed rotating hammer blades, causing them to break. There is a sieve plate at the bottom, and the crushed cake blocks flow out as small particles from under the sieve.
