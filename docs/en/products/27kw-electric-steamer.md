## Product Overview

This 27kW electric steamer is a completely new upgrade based on the older models produced in our factory. It features a thickened double-tank design with separate heating and water injection functions. The main water tank has a heating function, and the auxiliary water tank is a negative pressure water tank, providing water injection capabilities. The main water tank has a larger capacity, and both the water tanks and connecting pipes/fittings are made of 304 stainless steel.

## Key Features

-   **Safe and Reliable**: The water and electricity separation design ensures greater safety. The electric control has 3 adjustable gears, an emergency stop switch, and a quick-opening electric control inspection port.
-   **Convenient Discharge**: The pot body adopts a split design for convenient discharge. The pot body is directly embedded into the water basin, and a simple seal can prevent a large amount of steam from overflowing.
-   **Easy to Clean and Maintain**: Both the main and auxiliary water tanks have newly added drainage ports for easy cleaning of scale. The water float is independently installed in the auxiliary water tank, resulting in a lower failure rate. Additionally, a new quick-repair port for the water float has been added, and the independent design reduces maintenance costs.
-   **High Capacity**: A single steaming batch can handle up to 100Kg of material, and it takes only 7-10 minutes to steam and discharge the material.
