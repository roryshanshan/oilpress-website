## Series Overview

The 355 Series Hydraulic Oil Press is our classic model, suitable for small and medium-sized oil mills. This series features compact structure, simple operation, and stable performance.

It mainly consists of frame, hydraulic cylinder, and material barrel. The control box uses a microcomputer controller, all programs are software connected, and the control program will not be damaged. Note: The outer frame of this model is made of integrated molded steel plate cutting, with higher yield strength and stronger pressure bearing capacity.

The 355 model is suitable for hot pressing: sesame, tea seed, walnut, peanut, soybean, flax, rapeseed, sunflower seed, oil sludge, oil residue, meal residue, waste clay, animal oil residue, medicinal residue dehydration.

Dual barrel dual sliding track design - when one barrel is pressing, it does not affect the other barrel loading, greatly improving work efficiency.
