## Series Overview

The 500 Series Hydraulic Oil Press is our flagship model, specifically designed for the highest pressure requirements needed for cold pressing, suitable for all types of oil mills. This series represents the pinnacle of our engineering excellence with compact structure, simple operation, and exceptional performance.

It mainly consists of frame, hydraulic cylinder, and material barrel. The control box uses a microcomputer controller, all programs are software connected, and the control program will not be damaged. Note: The outer frame of this model is made of integrated molded steel plate cutting, with the highest yield strength and strongest pressure bearing capacity.

The 500 model is specially designed for cold pressing: walnut, sea buckthorn oil, perilla seed, coconut oil, tea seed, hemp seed, flaxseed, almond, pine nut, pumpkin seed, chemical waste clay, activated carbon decolorizer, etc.

Dual barrel dual sliding track design - when one barrel is pressing, it does not affect the other barrel loading, greatly improving work efficiency.
