## Hydraulic Oil Press Component Details

### Main Components
#### 1. Pump Station
+ The power source is an ultra-high pressure combined hydraulic station. The hydraulic station is equipped with high and low combined double pumps, with working pump pressure up to 80 MPa;
+ Pressure is five-plunger, high working pressure, easily reaching 60 MPa during operation;
+ Equipped with high and low pressure relief valves, double high pressure relief, no overpressure, safer;
+ The directional valve adopts ultra-high pressure four-core steering valve, not easy to leak and lose pressure, more wear-resistant and durable.

### 3. Hydraulic Cylinder
+ Cylinder produced in Daye, Hubei (state-owned enterprise), made of 27 silicon-manganese alloy tube material, cylinder barrel is tempered through heat treatment, more stable material performance, ultra-high pressure not easy to burst, pressure can reach 80 MPa;
+ Oil seal is imported from Japan, adopts high-pressure combined Glyd ring and retaining ring Y-type combined oil seal, more resistant to ultra-high pressure, double oil seals less likely to leak, using materials several times that of ordinary materials, excellent quality, strong sealing performance, not easy to leak oil;
+ Piston adopts two front and rear guide bands, less likely to damage the inner wall of the cylinder, will not run off and grind the wall.
