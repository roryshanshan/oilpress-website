## Product Overview

Our pneumatic multi-layer oil filter press features contact parts made of 304 stainless steel, with the entire machine designed with a high-gloss stainless steel mirror finish. All joint pipe fittings are also made of 304 stainless steel (with brass at the top), ensuring an aesthetically pleasing and hygienic appearance.

## Key Features

-   Integrated Design: The equipment comes with its own motor, gear pump, and air compressor, eliminating the need for additional purchases. It's ready to use simply by connecting to power.
-   Quick Opening Design: Based on customer feedback, the cover plate has been upgraded with a tempered glass transparent manhole design, allowing real-time observation of the liquid level inside the tank.
-   Easy Maintenance: The filter material can be replaced with filter paper, making cleaning easy and reducing usage costs.
-   Dual Safety Protection: Features a positive pressure design where the motor/air compressor automatically stops once the set pressure is reached. The top is equipped with a pressure relief safety valve, providing double safety assurance.
