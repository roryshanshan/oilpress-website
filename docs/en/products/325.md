## Series Overview

The 325 Series Hydraulic Oil Press is our classic model, suitable for small and medium-sized oil mills. This series features compact structure, simple operation, and stable performance.

It mainly consists of frame, hydraulic cylinder, and material barrel. The control box uses a microcomputer controller, all programs are software connected, and the control program will not be damaged. Note: The outer frame of these two models is made of channel steel (H-beam steel).

The 325 model is suitable for hot pressing: sesame, tea seed, walnut, peanut, soybean, flax, rapeseed, sunflower seed, oil sludge, oil residue, meal, waste clay, animal oil residue, medicinal residue dehydration.

Dual barrel dual sliding track design - when one barrel is pressing, it does not affect the other barrel loading, greatly improving work efficiency.
