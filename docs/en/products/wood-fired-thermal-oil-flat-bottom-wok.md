## Product Overview

* This flat-bottom wok comes with its own furnace. The thermal oil model solves the problem of uneven heating at the bottom of the wood-fired pot. This model is suitable for rural areas and urban-rural fringe areas where wood and natural gas can be burned, which can greatly save processing costs.
* A blower can be added independently to increase firepower, making combustion more complete and heating faster. The inner lining is rock wool insulation layer, and the outer package is made of stainless steel for a more beautiful appearance.
* 1.1kw silent motor, upgraded adjustable tension scraper, completely solves the problem of sticking to the bottom of the pot.
